# SampleAzureFunctions
This Repo is to store sample Azure Functions developed to support my blog posts at my blog :http://mythoughtlab.co.uk

##GeoCodeFile
This Azure Function will take a CSV file in the monitored Azure blob container and use Bing Maps to assign Lat & Long to each address entry.  

The sample input file for this was an extract from the UK Gov open data initiave.  It can be found in the inputfile/GeoCodeFile directory called address.csv
